# Newsletter-Signup
This is my solution to the "Newsletter Signup" from Frontend mentor using Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, TypeScript. 
The challenge comes with a few svgs. I didn't know how to use the picture element with the svgs, so I converted the svgs to jpgs.
In the code also is used "window.open("abc.html")" and that opens the html in a new tab. How do I open it in the same one?
Also if you see anything that cana be fixed or could look better, text me!
Thank you!
